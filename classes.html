	<p class="explanationParagraph">Many classes are used to make up the Game</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li class="class">Obstacles</li>
		<li class="classExplanation">There are 4 different obstacle classes, one for each direction. They're drawn at x and y values, and those values move across the screen at a random speed.</li>
		<li class="class">Food</li>
		<li class="classExplanation">The Food class has an x and a y, which are randomly assigned and then the food is drawn at those coordinates.</li>
		<li class="class">Powerups</li>
		<li class="classExplanation">Each powerup has a class assigned to it, typically just an x and a y value randomly assigned, and a d variable that assigns it's direction in the oscillation animation each powerup has.</li>
		<li class="class">Ship</li>
		<li class="classExplanation">The ship has a class of its own to help keep all of it's variables in one place. It has an x and a y value that are placed at the mouseX and mouseY. It also has an alive boolean so he can only be moved while alive and the game is running.</li>
